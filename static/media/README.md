# Media Files

This folder contains video and audio files for the Virra Care application.

## Files to Add:

1. **demo-video.mp4** - Main demonstration video (played after every AI response)
2. **demo-audio.mp3** - Main demonstration audio (played after every AI response)

## Supported Formats:

### Video:
- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM
- OGV

### Audio:
- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- OGG

## Usage:

The application will automatically include these media files in the chat interface after providing an AI response to any user question. The video and audio will play inline within the chat, not in a separate page or window.

For the POC (Proof of Concept), only one video and one audio file will be used regardless of the question asked.
